The objective of this problem is the removal of vertices to interrupt the
supply of military resources to the largest number of military units from
the headquarters, respecting the limit of firepower.
</h6>
<h6 style='text-align: center'>
Firepower is limited to six units of endurance and each military unit has
endurance of 1, 2 or 3 units, with the exception of the headquarters and
adjacent vertices which have 10000 and 100 respectively.
The vertex of the headquarters is distinguishable in the graph due to its
size, to differentiate it one can also observe the respective resistances.
</h6>
<h6 style='text-align: center'>
The sidebar has the mechanisms for interacting with the graph and in it you
can try a solution by choosing vertices to be removed. After each attempt
you will have as feedback the information if you completed the objective (a
feasible solution) and if you succeed, your solution will be compared with
the optimal solution obtained by integer programming.

        Given that the problem is represented as a graph $G=(V, E)$ and has headquarters node $k$,
        $c_{i}$ endurance for each of the military units and firepower limited to $L$, let's consider
        the variables $x_{i}$ $\forall i \in V$ which represents whether the node $i$ is disconnected
        with respect to the headquarters node and $y_{i}$ $\forall i \in V$ which represents whether
        the node $i$ has been removed.
        
        Therefore, we have the following integer programming model:

        $$
        Max \sum\limits_{i \in V}x_{i}
        $$

        Subject to:

        $$
        x_{k} = 0
        $$

        $$
        y_{i} + y_{j} \geq x_{i} - x_{j}, \space\space\space \forall (i, j) \in E
        $$

        $$
        y_{i} + y_{j} \geq x_{j} - x_{i}, \space\space\space \forall (i, j) \in E
        $$

        $$
        \sum\limits_{i \in V}c_{i}*y_{i} \leq L
