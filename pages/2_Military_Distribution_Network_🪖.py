    The objective in this context is the destruction of military units (removal of vertices) to interrupt the supply of military resources to the largest number of military units from the **headquarters**, respecting the limit of firepower.
    
    Firepower is limited to 6 units of endurance and each military unit has endurance of 1, 2 or 3 units, with the exception of the headquarters and adjacent units which have 10000 and 100 respectively.
    The vertex of the headquarters is distinguishable in the graph due to its size, to differentiate it one can also observe the respective resistances.

    The sidebar has the mechanisms for interacting with the graph and in it you can try a solution by choosing vertices to be removed.
    Then you will have as feedback the information if objective has been achieved (a viable solution) and if it succeeds, your solution will be compared with the optimal one obtained through the integer programming.

        As the problem is represented as a graph $G=(V, E)$ and has headquarters node $k$, $c_{i}$ **endurance** for each of the military units and firepower limited to $L$,
        let's consider the variables $x_{i}$ $\forall i \in V$ which represents whether the node $i$ is disconnected with respect to the headquarters node and $y_{i}$ $\forall i \in V$ which represents whether the node $i$ has been removed.
        
        Therefore, we have the following integer programming model:

        $$
        Max \sum\limits_{i \in V}x_{i}
