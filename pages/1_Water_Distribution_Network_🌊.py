The objective of this problem is to remove pipes (edges) in order to interrupt the water supply
from origin to destination. The origin and destination vertices are the only distinct ones to be
displayed in the graph, to differentiate them notice that the destination has a red x in its center.
</h6>
<h6 style='text-align: center'>
The sidebar has the mechanisms for interacting with the graph and in it you can try a solution by
choosing edges to be removed. After each attempt you will have as feedback the information if you
completed the objective (a feasible solution) and if you succeed, your solution will be compared
with the optimal solution obtained by integer programming.

        Given that the problem is represented as a graph $G=(V, E)$ and has origin and destination nodes and edges
        $(i, j) \in C$ colored red that cannot be removed, let's consider the variables $x_{i}$ $\forall i \in V$
        which represents whether the node $i$ is disconnected with respect to the origin and $y_{i, j}$
        $\forall (i, j) \in E$ which represents whether the edge $(i, j)$ has been removed.
        
        Therefore, we have the following integer programming model:

        $$
        Min \sum\limits_{(i, j) \in E}y_{i, j}
        $$

        x_{origin} = 0
        $$

        $$
        x_{destination} = 1
        $$

        $$
        y_{i, j} \geq x_{i} + x_{j}, \space\space\space \forall (i, j) \in E
